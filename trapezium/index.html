    <h1>How do I calculate the area of a trapezium?</h1>
    <p>To calculate the area of a trapezium you would take the average of the two bases and multiply it by the height</p>
    <h2 id="formula">Area = middle base × height</h2>
    <p>To calculate the middle base, it's basically just the arithmetic mean of both bases</p>
    <h2 id="formula">Middle base = ( Top Base + Bottom Base) ÷ 2</h2>
    <p>So, in other words, the formula would simply be:</p>
    <h2 id="formula">( ( Top Base + Bottom Base) ÷ 2 ) × height</h2>
